<h2>Corporate, State, and Bad Actors</h2>
<p>
  Privacy NOW aims to empower the average user to operate privately online if
  they so choose.

<p>
  Our philosophy is that a locked backdoor, even if only for use of the state,
  is still a backdoor and can be utilized by bad actors. To that effect, for
  example, we only sell thinkpads in which the intel ME backdoor system has been
  neutured, Graphene OS supported phones, and Purism laptops with hardware kill
  switches.
